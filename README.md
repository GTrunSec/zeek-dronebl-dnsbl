# zeek-dronebl-dnsbl

This [Zeek](https://zeek.org)'s script allows you to check IP's against
[DroneBL](https://dronebl.org/)'s database.
You can find some **documentation** in the *export* section of the source-code.

It is still a work in progress, thus some functionality is missing.

**Written and tested for Zeek/Bro version 2.6.1**
